## Overview

The analysis is categorized into three primary views:

1. **Operational Insights**: Focuses on trip counts, passenger metrics, and monthly trends.
2. **Customer Insights**: Examines passenger behavior, repeat usage patterns, and demographics.
3. **Financial Insights**: Analyzes revenue patterns, fare trends, and city-level financial contributions.

### **Source of Dataset**

The dataset for this analysis is sourced from **GoodCabs's internal databases**, namely:

1. **`trips_db`**: Contains detailed and aggregated trip data, passenger behavior, and repeat trip metrics for tier-2 cities.
2. **`targets_db`**: Holds monthly operational targets, including new passenger acquisition goals, trip counts, and customer satisfaction metrics.

These datasets provide rich information on city-wise trip trends, passenger demographics, and financial benchmarks, enabling a data-driven approach to insights and decisions.
